# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview of Project
**Explain the purpose of the new analysis.**

In this project, we created a summary of the ride-shring data by city type summariing their fare rates. The results of this summary were presented in a multi-line graph created using Pandas and Matplotlib. These results will be used by decision-makers at Pyber.



## Results
**Using images from the summary DataFrame and multiple-line chart, describe the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types.**

By looking at the summary above, we can determine that the city type: Uraban has the greatest number of the total Riders and Total Drivers, then folllowed by the suburban type and rutral type. However, the average fare per ride and the average fare per Driver is lower in Urabn type and higher in the Rural city type. Eventhough there is the average fare per ride is lower in the Urban type, due to the higher numberof riders, the total fare amount is higher for this city type comapered with the other city type Total Fares.

As we can see from the multi-line chart the fare amount is higher of the Urban city type throughout the months, followed by the suburban type and then rural type. Also, we can determine that the higher fares amoount have almost the same increases for all the city types and all of them had a drop through the month of March. However, the fare amount for the urban city type is not stable as it have frequent drops and incraeses through the months.

## Summary
**Based on the results, provide three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types.**

Based on the DataFrame summery and the chart, as the urban city type have the lowest rates for the drivers will result to less expensis on the salary for the drivers, which means higher profit. Eventhough the fare rates for riders are lower, the total number of riders is way higher than the other city types,which creates a higher total amount. This means that investing in the urban city type will have higher profit for the company if operating in the urban city type.
